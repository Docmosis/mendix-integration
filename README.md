# Mendix-Docmosis Integration

## Introduction

This module simplifies generating documents from your Mendix app by using the [Docmosis Cloud](https://www.docmosis.com/products/cloud.html) document generation service.

You will need [a Docmosis Cloud Account](https://www.docmosis.com/products/cloud/try.html) to use this module.

## Processing Locations
You have complete control over where your templates are stored and where processing occurs.  Choose from [processing locations in the USA, EU and Asia/Pacific regions](https://www.docmosis.com/products/cloud/processing-locations.html) to ensure low latency and geo-bound processing.

## Security and Reliability
We understand that Security and Reliability are essential.  Below is a summary of our [Cloud Security Measures](https://www.docmosis.com/products/cloud/security-measures.html):
- Load balanced, high-performance, redundant, geographically distributed and monitored 24/7.
- Over 99.99% uptime consistently for over 7 years.
- All communication with the Docmosis Cloud is SSL encrypted and templates and other uploaded content are stored encrypted at rest.

We generate a test document every 60 secondsâ€¦ view the live [Status Page](https://www.docmosis.com/status) and [Historical Uptime Statistics](https://www.docmosis.com/monitoring).

## The module

This Mendix module simplifies generating documents from your app using Docmosis. It is a wrapper around the Docmosis Cloud service.
The module handles all web service complexity so you don't have to be an expert on that and you can focus on generating documents.

In the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Docmosis/mendix-integration) you will find a project with some showcases and feel free to copy it to your own project or use it as inspiration. The author of the module uses it to test the module.
