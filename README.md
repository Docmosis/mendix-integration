# Docmosis Cloud

## Introduction

[Docmosis Cloud](https://www.docmosis.com/products/cloud.html) is an online service to generate documents from your data. It works like mail merge, where you combine a document template and data to automatically generate documents. With Docmosis you create the document template using Microsoft Word or LibreOffice and the data is your app's data.

Output formats can be PDF, Doc, DocX, ODT, HTML and RTF; one at time or multiple at once.

[Docmosis Tornado](https://www.docmosis.com/products/tornado.html) is an on premise deployment of the same product. So this documentation applies to Docmosis Tornado too.

> Any reference to Docmosis is short for Docmosis Cloud, Docmosis Tornado or the company Docmosis.

## The module

This Mendix module simplifies generating documents from your app using Docmosis. It is a wrapper around the Docmosis web services. All you need is a Docmosis access key and a good understanding of your reporting needs and the data in your app. The module handles all web service complexity so you don't have to be an expert on that and you can focus on generating documents.

In the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Docmosis/mendix-tools) you will find a project with some showcases and feel free to copy it to your own project or use it as inspiration. The author of the module uses it to test the module.
